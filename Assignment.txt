I initially created the folder by the name of grepoassignment.

Initiate the folder by doing git init.

I have created the files called html, css and md files.

I then checked the status by git status command

git add .

git commit with a message 

git remote add origin https://github.com/kaabboo/GitHubRepoAsgmnt.git

git push -u origin master
